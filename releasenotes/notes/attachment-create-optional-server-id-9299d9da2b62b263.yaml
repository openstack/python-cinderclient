    When attaching to a host, we don't need a server id
    so it shouldn't be mandatory to be supplied with
    attachment-create operation.
    The server_id parameter is made optional so we can
    create attachments without passing it.
    The backward compatibility is maintained so we can pass
    it like how we currently do if required.
