    # Just to be clear what's going on here: which python is used by
    # tox is controlled by tox.ini.  But, that python needs to
    # actually be available on the node running the job in order for
    # the job to succeed.  At this point, we can assume that 3.6 will
    # be available everywhere (this is guaranteed by openstack-infra).
    # But 3.7 is still problematic (don't ask me why).  So for this
    # job that we want running in py3.7, we need to (a) specify a
    # nodeset for which py3.7 is available, and (b) tell the job to
    # make sure it's available (i.e., install it if necessary).
    # (a) is handled by the 'nodeset' specification below.
    # (b) is handled by the setting the 'python_version' variable
    #     below, although by itself that doesn't do anything: it also
    #     requires that the 'ensure-python' role is included in the
    #     job playbook.
